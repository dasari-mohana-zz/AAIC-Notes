# AAIC Notes
These are my personal notes, feel free to use them for your reference. Some of the material in lectures is not included because I already knew about it. I've used a lot of profane words for keeping humor in long study sessions, don't be offended. These are my personal notes, make your own if you feel the need to correct my language. I also have notes for the Interview Prep Course, check out the relevant repo in my profile. </br>
