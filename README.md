# Applied AI Course - Notes
These are my personal notes, feel free to use them for your reference. Some of the material in lectures is not included because I already knew about it. Which is why these notes are meant just for reference/revision, not for learning. I've used a lot of profane words for keeping humor in long study sessions, don't be offended. </br>

Right now I'm focusing on the live sessions, I'll add more main chapters afterwards. I'll keep updating the repo every week with new notes. Even if a handful of people find this useful, my goal will be acheived. Enjoy the notes! 

I also have notes for the Interview Prep Course, check out the relevant repo in my profile.</br>
